# Self Hosted

A bunch of files used in my self hosting adventures. The current state of my self hosted services are:

- PiVPN (Wireguard) to be able to access my network from outside
- Home Assistant for my home automation
- Navidrome, a music streaming server that replaced Spotify for my own music collection

The next step will probably be a Nextcloud instance.
